Hi! I am XGN from HHS. XGN stands for XiaoGeNintendo or XiaoGeNull or something else. HHS stands for Hell Hole Studios
I am a student at Nanjing Foreign Language School.
I am Chinese, born in 2004. Birthday is Dec. 19.

I play games, watch animes and listen to music often.
You can see what games I play in the game title section. I use Bangumi to trace my anime progress, you can find my profile link there.

I also do Competitive Programming. 
Max rating on Codeforces is currently Master.

I suck at frontend designs cuz I suck at Arts and Music.
I love composing but I can't compose well.

I love animals especially fluffy one. You can say I am a furry.
Cats are so cute~ Foxes too~
